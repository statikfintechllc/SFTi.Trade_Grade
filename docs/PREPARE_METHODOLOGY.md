## The Seven Components

### P - Pattern/Price (20 Points)

**What to Evaluate:**
- Technical chart pattern quality
- Price structure and key levels
- Pattern clarity and reliability
- Historical pattern success rate

**Scoring Guidelines:**

| Points | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 18-20  | Perfect setup with clear, textbook pattern. Multiple confirmations. |
| 15-17  | Strong pattern with minor imperfections. Most confirmations present. |
| 10-14  | Decent pattern but lacks some confirmation or has competing signals. |
| 5-9    | Weak pattern or unclear setup. Mixed signals. |
| 0-4    | Poor pattern recognition. High ambiguity. |

**Examples:**
- **20 points**: Clean cup and handle on daily chart with volume confirmation
- **15 points**: Bull flag with slight irregularity but strong prior trend
- **10 points**: Potential breakout but resistance nearby
- **5 points**: Choppy price action, unclear direction

### R - Risk/Reward (20 Points)

**What to Evaluate:**
- Distance to stop loss vs profit target
- Risk/reward ratio calculation
- Position sizing potential
- Win rate required to be profitable

**Scoring Guidelines:**

| Points | R:R Ratio | Win Rate Needed |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 18-20  | 4:1 or better | 20% or less |
| 15-17  | 3:1 to 3.9:1 | 25% |
| 10-14  | 2:1 to 2.9:1 | 33% |
| 5-9    | 1.5:1 to 1.9:1 | 40% |
| 0-4    | Less than 1.5:1 | 50%+ |

**Formula:**
```
R:R Ratio = (Target Price - Entry Price) / (Entry Price - Stop Loss)
```

**Examples:**
- **20 points**: Entry $100, Stop $95, Target $120 (4:1 ratio)
- **15 points**: Entry $50, Stop $48, Target $56 (3:1 ratio)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Score Inflation
- Don't round up "just because"
- Be honest about weaknesses
- A perfect score is rare

### ❌ Ignoring Low Scores
- Don't trade if total is below 60
- One component at 0-2 is a red flag
- Missing multiple components = skip

### ❌ Trading Without Grading
- Don't skip the process
- Emotional trading leads to losses
- System keeps you disciplined

### ❌ Changing Rules Mid-Trade
- Don't adjust scores after entry
- Plan the trade, trade the plan
- Review afterwards, not during

---

## Tips for Consistent Grading

1. **Grade Before Looking at Price**
   - Prevents bias from recent moves
   - More objective assessment

2. **Use Historical Comparisons**
   - Compare to previous A-grade trades
   - Calibrate your scoring

3. **Document Your Reasoning**
   - Note why each score was assigned
   - Review accuracy over time

4. **Track Score Accuracy**
   - Did A grades perform better?
   - Were D grades correctly avoided?
   - Refine system based on results

5. **Grade Consistently**
   - Use same criteria every time
   - Don't get easier or harder
   - Maintain standards

## Advanced Techniques

### Weighted Scoring

Some traders weight components based on their strategy:
- Day traders: +5 points to Timing
- Swing traders: +5 points to Pattern
- Risk-focused: +5 points to Risk/Reward

### Context-Specific Adjustments

**Bull Market:**
- Environment scores generally higher
- Catalyst less critical
- Entry/exit easier

**Bear Market:**
- Require higher overall score (85+ minimum)
- Catalyst more important
- Tighter stops regardless

**High Volatility:**
- Risk/Reward becomes most critical
- Entry/Exit harder (wider spreads)
- Timing more important
